# Comparative-Evaluation-of-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Malicious-URL-Detection
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning models, including decision trees, random forests, KNN, and naive Bayes, for the effective detection of malicious URLs in a large-scale dataset, highlighting the superior accuracy of ensemble models while acknowledging challenges in data imbalance.

## Abstract
This research delves into the critical issue of identifying malicious URLs, which are instrumental in cybercrimes like phishing and malware dissemination, leading to significant financial repercussions globally. The study rigorously evaluates various machine learning models including decision trees, random forests, KNN, and naive Bayes, to efficiently discern malicious URLs within a substantial dataset comprising over half a million URLs. Notably, ensemble models such as random forest and extra trees demonstrate remarkable efficacy, achieving over 91% accuracy. However, the disparity in data distribution remains a notable challenge, particularly for less frequently occurring malicious URL types. This comparative analysis underscores the viability and effectiveness of ensemble machine learning techniques in the automated detection of malicious URLs, highlighting the potential of these models in enhancing cybersecurity measures.

## Introduction
The internet, a pivotal tool for global connectivity, has profoundly transformed how information, services, and communication are accessed, with nearly 4.5 billion individuals worldwide connected online. Despite its benefits, this widespread connectivity has opened avenues for cyber threats such as phishing, spam, and malware, leading to substantial financial losses globally, estimated to be around $1.5 trillion annually. Malicious URLs, a common vector for these threats, often employ deceptive tactics to masquerade as legitimate, making them difficult to distinguish. The urgency for automated detection of these URLs is paramount to enhance cybersecurity proactively, rather than reacting post-attack. This paper contributes to this domain by presenting a comparative study of various standard machine learning models, examining their effectiveness in accurately differentiating between benign and malicious URLs.
